# 2D Dodgeball Python Game

This project is a python based game utilizing object oriented programming that can be played locally on any machine. Pygame modules are used in this project. 

It is a collision based game where the players and dodgeballs have rectangular hitboxes that, when intersect, trigger particular events and animations to occur during gameplay. 

The game features multiple windows for the start screen, controls screen, and actual gameplay screen as well as functioning animations.  

### Challenges

The animations for this game were quite challenging. Due to the lack of preparation time and changes from the initial vision I had for the game, I coded the animations without start, pause, and end functions which would have made the integration, organization, and readability much easier. 

Given time, I would have liked to integrate a better winning screen animation as well as text input from the players to get their names. I would have also liked to modify and improve the animation class to feature the functions stated above and make the code more clean.

### Requirements and Installation  

This game requires no outside installations other than the files provided. To run the game, just download all files under the **2D_Dodgeball_Game** repository and run the main.py python file directly. The game will not start if you run any other file.
